The Travelling Salemens Problem.
Earlier this year (2016) my school ran a trip for the Computer Science students to attend a day's worth of lechtures at Swansea University. One of the lechtures involved the Travelling Salesmen Problem and how there was no defined solution but only a series of workarounds. A challenge the lechturer set at the end of the day was to see if any of the students were able to solve the problem. 
This is my attempt at solving this problem, I actually provide solutions to two different variations of the problem which are:

1. The shortest distance between a set of points in any order using greedy algorithm logic.
2. The shorest distance between a set of points where only certain points were connected like a road system, where junctions are points. Again using greedy algorithm logic.

I did sent my solutions via email to the lechturer and did tweak my solutions with some advice he gave me. **Don't** except amazing things from this project it is only avaiable now since I have no use for the code anymore. 
Maybe someone will find a use for this code if you do sent me a tweet [@MoppletopMC](https://twitter.com/MoppletopMC)
